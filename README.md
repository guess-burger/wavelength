# wavelength

FIXME: my new application.


## Running

Spin up a repl using `clj -M:repl/run` and that _should_ start the server on 8080

You probably need a cljs build step _somewhere_ but using `clj -M:repl/fig` for now to run fig-wheel

## TODO

* [_] Clean up and document stately
* [_] Something more stylish 
* [_] Make a custom slider
  * [_] Or maybe just make the on we have less "wonky"


### Things to keep an eye on


### Bugs

* No inputs to stately cause hot-loop if there is a default that recurs
  * I mean what does it mean have to have no inputs... that seems an error
  * Actually... is it that the real problem or it that it now null since they are closed
    * probably need to figure out leaving asap and make it reusable 
* Deck is an infinite sequence that which is fine until println tries to walk the entire thing
  * Will a logging framework make the same mistake? How can you get around it? 
  * Logging frameworks don't handle this!!
* Long wavelength prompts render a bit strange (GH issue #2)
* Slider is totally wonky and off the further up the bar you go
